## zkVM Methods

This folder contains the [zkVM] portion of your [Bonsai] application. 
In typical use cases, you will only need to edit the code inside `guest/src/bin` which is where you write the source code for your [guest program].

To learn more about the architecture of Bonsai apps and zkVM apps, check out the [developer documentation]. Note that the Bonsai Ethereum Relay acts as the zkVM host and so you do not need to write zkVM host code yourself.
